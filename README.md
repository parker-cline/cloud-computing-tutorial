# Fake Video Studios

This is the Terraform code that allows you to provision a “Fake Video Studios” web application that would allow users to upload a character photo and a script, to which the video generators will generate a video in 15 minutes using this photo and script. 

It's part of a tutorial article I wrote that introduces some really useful concepts of cloud computing! This article was written for a class assignment, but it may be published on Medium someday for the world to see.

Feel free to clone the repo so you can build the architecture for yourself!
